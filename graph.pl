Graph representation:

graph(VertexList, EdgeList)

g([1,2,3,4,5], [e(1,2), e(2,3), e(3,4), e(2,5), e(5,3)])		 

directed graph   1 ----> 2 1 is connected with 2
                           2 is not connected wiht 1
						  
undirected graph 1 ----- 2  1 is connected with 2
                            2 is connected wiht 1 
It is possible to represent path and visited in two ways.

Path as 
 - list of points (vertex) or
 - list of lines  (edges)
 
Visited
 - list of points (vertex)
 - list of lines  (edges)
